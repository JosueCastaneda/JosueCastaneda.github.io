                    I am currently doing a PhD in Computer Science in France at the Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architecture des systèmes (<a href="https://www.laas.fr/public/en">LAAS</a>).
                    My main work is on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). More specifically in the multi-domain orchestration of network services.
                    I am interested in the coordination of multiple orchestrators that have partial knowledge to support the correct execution of network services.

                    I have work experience as a Software engineer in research projects at Samsung Research Tijuana (SRT). I supervised a team of four in a research project. Most of my
                    work dealt with machine learning and distributed systems. Also, I was involved in many internal projects to continue education within the team such as training, seminars.

                    I also hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (<a href="https://ccc.inaoep.mx/en/">INAOE</a>).
                    My thesis on bio-inspired data foraging relates the abstract notion of indirect communication with the spatial and
                    temporal causality of events in order to identify regions of interest in an unknown and dynamic environment.

                    My interest are: Distributed systems, formal systems, software architecture and competitive programming.
